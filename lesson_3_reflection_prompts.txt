When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Sharing with multiple people
    Will be adding files from different computers
    To save an accessable version on the web to pull later

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For the same reason you would manually commit changes: you want to ensure
    that the integrity of each commit is solid

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clones copy a repository, branches split off a new section of a repository
    that will not affect the other branches, and a fork is a clone of a
    repository from another user that has been cloned on GitHub. The clones and 
    branches are for your own use while a fork takes someone else's code 
    while maintaining the branched link to their code base.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you are offline you can still compare your files to the remote files

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Save files to a secondary folder for review before saving to the master file
    and logging the old file for an archive. Almost nonoe of this would be easier
    than using Git as far as I can see

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If you are going to be merging it back into a collaborative project. Then 
    other collaboators can see what changes have been made in that branch before it
    being apporved to merge with the main line.
